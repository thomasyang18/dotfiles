alright so this is the default junko setup I guess? 

Man, my *.ttf folder is already 220MB jesus christ. I need a better way to keep track of assets and shit with my setup, lol. 

But whatever; we don't recreate desktop envs often anyways so :/ 

the ultimate test is seeing how well my scripts hold up on arch or something (well then apt wont be the packaage manager soooooo AAAAAAAAAAA)
