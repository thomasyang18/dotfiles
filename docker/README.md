- System Clipboard does not work in docker - I think this is fine? I don't know how to expose the system clipboard to docker but neither woudl I want to usually, right? Ehh... maybe because we're googling shit we want stuff to be easily copy pastable. But looking around, seems hacky and complicated. Okay, well :/
